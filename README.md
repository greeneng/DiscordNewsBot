# DiscordNewsBot
Simple RSS feeds reposter for Discord servers

This script uses Discord API for Python to make simple bot that reposts RSS news on the server.

HTML/XML is converted to Discord's markdown format to preserve formatting as much as possible. 
Rendering may be different depending on the tags of RSS entry.

You must generate your own Bot Token and User ID before using it.
